# bcc-icons
Icons used in the BCC design system, adapted from Material Symbols.

[![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@bcc-code/icons)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bcc-code/icons) ![license](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@bcc-code/icons) [![install size](https://packagephobia.com/badge?p=@bcc-code/icons)](https://packagephobia.com/result?p=@bcc-code/icons)

The basis of this package are the [outlined SVG icons](https://github.com/marella/material-design-icons/tree/main/svg/outlined) from [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.style=Outlined). Some icons might be redesigned by the design team and replace the default icons.

## Usage
Every icon is compiled as a Vue component, which can be used like this:

```js
import { SearchIcon } from "@bcc-code/icons";
```
